September 2008

fixed a few problems with the GUI:
- warning when passing an image name on the guiSaliency command line eliminated
- "Window close" button on guiSaliency main window now works properly
- updating of the "Attended Loaction" window when loading a new image now works
  for all visualization modes

fixed some path and name problems with mex files:
- added support for 64 bit Windows platforms (mexw64)
  (Compilation for 64 bit Vista so far only using a modified scheme using Visual Studio)
- mex files for Windows now have the proper file extensions mexw32 and mexw64
- for older versions of Matlab dll files are included
- To avoid annoying warnings in Matlab versions expecting .mexw32 mex files, 
  the .dll files are automatically renamed into .dll.old on the first call 
  of initializeGlobal
- both the mex files and their .m help files are now in SaliencyToolbox/mex
- the source code for the mex files is in SaliencyToolbox/src

phased out fatal.m and replaced it with error everywhere

fixed minor bug in centerSurround.m
- center and surround levels were accientally swapped in the csLevels structure

new parameter options in salParams:
- params.oriComputeMode: one of 'efficient' (default) or 'full'
  'efficient' only computes orientation filters for the levels that are actually
              going to be used in the center-surround computation
              This speeds up computation of the saliency map by about a factor of 2.
  'full' computes the orientation filters for all levels as before
- params.exclusionMask: struct of type map or 2d mask of numeric or logical type
                        regions where exclusionMask is ~= 0 are excluded from the saliency 
                        computations by setting all feature maps to 0 in these areas. The 
                        mask is automatically resized to the size of the feature maps.
- params.IORdecay: sets the decay rate of the inhibitive conductance responsible for 
                   inihibiiton of return per simulation step of 0.1 ms. This parameter
                   was so far hidden in initializeWTA.m

batchSaliency.m can now handle directories that contain images and other files. It will
automatically only load the images.


===============================================================================

September 2007
release of version 2.1

- added batchSaliency for batch processing of multiple images

maxNormalizeIterative, estimateShape, sepConv2PreserveEnergy
- fixed boundary conditions for 2d convolution to prevent bleeding
  of energy off the edge. This is a critical update!

displayMap
- changed normalization such that empty maps appear black instead of gray


===============================================================================

July 2007
release of version 2.0

Replaced license agreement.

guiSaliency, guiLevelParams
- new GUI version of the code

checkImageSize, runSaliency, guiSaliency
- check for too large images, prompt user to confirm downsampling

defaultSaliencyParams, defaultLevelParams, centerSurround, winnerToImgCoords
- made levelParams its own data structure

maxNormalizeLocalMax, defaultSaliencyParams, maxNormalize
- renamed maxNormalizeStd into maxNormalizeLocalMax

plotSalientLocation, defaultSaliencyParams
- introduced VisualizationStyle option

all mex files
- removed all GPL code from these files

Filters.cpp, Filters.h
- removed functions no longer needed

estimateShape.m
- make shape estimation more robust by checking that the attended
  location is actually inside the attended shape (duh!)


===============================================================================


November 2006
